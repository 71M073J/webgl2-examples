# ES6/WebGL 2.0 Examples
A collection of ES6/WebGL 2.0 examples for undergraduate computer graphics courses.

# Building and running
The examples do not need to be built, but some of them require a server
capable of serving static files (WebGL+CORS restrictions).

If python is installed, a decent enough server for this task is:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
